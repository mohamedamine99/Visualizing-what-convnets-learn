This repository provides an in-depth exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by focusing on the visualization of filters. CNNs are powerful deep-learning models commonly used for image recognition tasks, and understanding how they learn and extract features from images is crucial for their effective utilization.

## Why visualize filters of a CNN?

The main objective of this project is to demystify the inner workings of CNNs by visualizing the filters learned during the training process. By examining the learned filters, we gain insights into what features the network has learned to detect and how these features are represented within the model.

By visualizing the filters, we can understand the patterns and textures detected at different layers. This understanding allows us to effectively extract and transfer style elements from one image to another, resulting in the creation of artistic and visually appealing stylized images.


To delve deeper into neural style transfer, you can refer to the [original paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) or explore this [repository](https://github.com/mohamedamine99/Neural-Style-Transfer-with-Python/tree/main), which provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the step-by-step process for accomplishing neural style transfer tasks.
