This repository provides an in-depth exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by focusing on the visualization of filters. CNNs are powerful deep learning models commonly used for image recognition tasks, and understanding how they learn and extract features from images is crucial for their effective utilization.

## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to demystify the inner workings of CNNs by visualizing the filters learned during the training process. By examining the learned filters, we gain insights into what features the network has learned to detect and how these features are represented within the model.
